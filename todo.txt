test using only 1 pipe
if an execve fails the program should continue
if infile does not exist, print an error, but rin the commands anyways
bonus
use access
use perror
leaks
heredoc running commands via command substitution? eg: $(echo Hello)
tee to use a thirdfile

- if infile doesn't exist
- if infile exists but no perms
- if outfile doesn't exist
- if outfile exists but no perms
- if can't access command
